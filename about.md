# About the machine

This site is about what we like to call The Machine.

What is the machine? 

The machine is an opinionated way of doing agile for projects that need to be in production very quickly. 

This set of practices is specially important if success depends on its [Time to market](https://en.wikipedia.org/Time To Market)

We have noticed that agile development more often than not easily degenerates to the most waterfall version that still classifies as agile. 

Processes that: 
 - Are not adaptive
 - Require excessive documentation
 - Require too much ceremonies
 - Metrics become goals
